websocket auth : 
(see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/websocket-security)
	- pass JWT in query string (see code in java)
	- auth extern 
	- Smuggle access tokens inside Sec-WebSocket-Protocol

Since the only header a browser will let you control is Sec-WebSocket-Protocol, 
you can abuse it to emulate any other header. Interestingly (or rather comically),
 this is what Kubernetes is doing. In short, you append whatever you need for 
 authentication as an extra supported subprotocol inside Sec-WebSocket-Protocol:

var ws = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/path", ["realProtocol", "yourAccessTokenOrSimilar"]);

Then, on the server, you add some sort of middleware that transforms the request 
back to its saner form before passing it further into the system. Terrible, yes, 
but so far the best solution. No tokens in the URL, no custom authentication save 
for the little middleware, no extra state on the server needed. 
 Do not forget to include the real subprotocol, as various tools will 
 reject a connection without one.

dont:
	- via cookie (very unsecure with ws)
