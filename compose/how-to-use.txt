Store here compose file for each service (format: compose.service_name.yml)
File path need to be wrote in Makefile too.
You can take example on other conpose file here.
Don't forget to add ENV variable inside env.dev (at root)

In your compose file :
*	/!\	each `service` in the compose file need to be unique, same for `volume`	/!\
*	no need to add network or version 
*	if you want you app to NOT start automatically and use it in "dev" mode:
		- no entrypoint
		- add this:
		    stdin_open: true 
		    tty: true
		(it's like the"dev" local compose (whose should be located in your app folder))
	keep in mind that in this mode the django server of your app doesn't start by itself, 
	and so all app in dev mode need to be started manually
*	else just set an entrypoint and no sttdin/tty
