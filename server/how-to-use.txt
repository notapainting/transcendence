This directory is for the NO-WAF nginx reverse-proxy

The goals is to filter all request to our apps api via this proxy 
=>	it mean that in frontend code, all fetch should be done to the proxy host/port 
	(8080/8443 in unprivilieged host)

to add a location to your backend api:
	- copy-paste the following template in `nginx.proxy.conf` inside the main server block
	- change the FOO value 
	- /!\ pay attention to trailling `/` and protocol/port /!\:
		- there is one after location `/FOO/` so in frontend fetch to `/FOO?` not /FOO 
		- there is NOTHING after FOO in proxy_pass, if you set something it will erase the original request
		- in backend we use HTTP (no need for httpS because it's supposed to be a safe network)
		- the default port for django app is 8000, but you should set it to the actual value you use

	# proxy for FOO api
	location /FOO/ {
		proxy_pass http://FOO:8000;

		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
	}
